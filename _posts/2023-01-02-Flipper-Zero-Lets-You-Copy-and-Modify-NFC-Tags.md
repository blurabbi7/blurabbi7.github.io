### What are NFC tags?
---

NFC tags are small chips that can store and transmit data wirelessly when they are placed close to an NFC-enabled device such as a smartphone. 
They can be easily programmed to perform a variety of tasks, and they are often used in applications where security is important. For example, NFC tags can be used to unlock doors, access secure areas, or authenticate users.

Many different types of NFC tags are available, each with unique capabilities. Some NFC tags are designed to be read-only, meaning that they can only transmit data and cannot be modified. Other NFC tags are writable, which means that they can be programmed with new data or have their existing data modified.

### How to write NFC tags using Flipper Zero?

To use Flipper Zero, you simply place an NFC tag near the device and use the accompanying app to read and modify the data stored on the tag. The app allows you to view the data on the tag and make changes as needed. You can also use Flipper Zero to create new NFC tags by copying the data from an existing tag and saving it to a blank tag using the NFC magic tool available from unleashed firmware: https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware

One of the key features of the NFC Magic tool is its ability to write NFC tags. This means that you can create multiple copies of an NFC tag with the same data, allowing you to use the same tag for multiple purposes or share it with others.

Flipper Zero is easy to use and requires almost no technical expertise. It is a valuable tool for anyone looking to customize and enhance the functionality of NFC tags.
