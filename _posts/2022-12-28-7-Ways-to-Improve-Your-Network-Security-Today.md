### 1) Keep Your Software Updated

Keeping your software up-to-date is an important part of any cybersecurity strategy. 
Hackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in outdated software, so it’s important to keep all of your software and operating systems updated with the latest security patches. 
Regularly updating your software ensures that you’re taking advantage of the most recent improvements in security technology, making it harder for hackers to exploit any flaws in your system. 
Additionally, many security patches address newly discovered vulnerabilities, meaning that if you aren’t keeping your software updated, you could be leaving yourself open to attack. 
For maximum security, make sure to set your computer or device to automatically install updates whenever they become available. You should also regularly check for updates manually if you don’t have this feature enabled. 
Updating your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve your network security today.

### 2) Use Strong Passwords

Passwords are the key to keeping your network secure. As such, it’s important that you use strong passwords and change them regularly. 
A strong password should contain at least 8 characters, a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases as passwords, and don’t use the same password for multiple accounts.
You can also use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords in one secure place. 
Password managers also offer an additional layer of security because they require you to authenticate with a master password or with biometrics before accessing stored passwords. 
Finally, if you have a large number of users on your network, you may want to consider implementing a password policy. 
This will help to ensure that all users have strong passwords and that they are changed on a regular basis.

### 3) Use a VPN

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide an extra layer of security for your network, by encrypting all the data that passes through it. 
VPNs are especially important if you're using an unsecured public Wi-Fi connection, or if you're accessing sensitive information remotely.
A VPN creates a secure tunnel between your computer and the server, and then encrypts all the data that passes through it. 
This means that any information you transmit can only be accessed by someone who has the correct credentials to access the server. 
Additionally, this encryption protects against malicious hackers who might be trying to intercept your data.
When choosing a VPN, make sure it is a reputable provider that offers strong encryption and privacy policies. 
Moreover, some providers offer additional features such as kill switch, DNS leak protection, and split tunneling.
By using a VPN, you can ensure that your network is safe and secure from any potential threats, while still allowing you to access the Internet securely.

### 4) Avoid Public Wi-Fi


Public Wi-Fi is everywhere and can be very convenient, but it also presents a major security risk. 
When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your data is exposed to anyone who is connected to the same network. 
Hackers can easily eavesdrop on your data and view sensitive information, such as passwords or financial information. 
It’s also possible for hackers to intercept communications between you and the access point, and gain control of the connection. 
To protect yourself from these risks, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when connecting to public Wi-Fi. 
A VPN encrypts your data before it leaves your device and provides secure tunneling to a remote server. 
This makes it impossible for anyone on the same network to intercept your data. 
Another way to stay safe while using public Wi-Fi is to limit the amount of sensitive data you share while connected. 
Avoid accessing online banking accounts or sending sensitive emails. 
If you must access a sensitive website, make sure that it uses HTTPS encryption to keep your data secure. 
In summary, it’s best to avoid public Wi-Fi whenever possible. 
If you must use public Wi-Fi, use a VPN and be careful what information you send or receive while connected. 
Taking these extra steps will help you stay safe while surfing the web.

### 5) Educate Yourself and Employees about Cybersecurity


When it comes to protecting your business from cyber threats, education is key. To ensure that your network is as secure as possible, you and your employees need to be aware of the potential risks and have the skills to identify and respond appropriately.
First, understand the different types of cyber threats that exist. The most common forms include malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Educate yourself and your employees about how each of these threats work, what warning signs to look for, and the best ways to protect your systems.
Second, teach yourself and your team how to recognize a suspicious email or website. Phishing emails are designed to look legitimate, so it’s important to look out for red flags such as unusual requests for information or misspellings in the sender’s name. Similarly, beware of any links sent from an unknown source as these could be malicious.
Finally, ensure that everyone on your team understands the importance of good password hygiene. Encourage them to use strong passwords that contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should also be changed regularly.
By educating yourself and your employees about cybersecurity, you can make sure that your network is secure and protected against any potential cyberattacks.

### 6) Use Two-Factor Authentication


Two-factor authentication is an important part of protecting your network. It adds an extra layer of security, requiring users to enter a code that is sent to their device in order to gain access to the network. This prevents unauthorized access and helps protect your data from being accessed by someone who has gained access to your passwords.
To set up two-factor authentication, you can use a number of different methods, including text message codes, voice codes, or even biometric scans. Each method has its own pros and cons, so it’s important to understand which type of authentication best fits your needs.
For businesses that handle sensitive information, two-factor authentication is especially important as it helps prevent data theft and other cyber threats. Even if a hacker was able to gain access to a user’s credentials, they would still need to enter the second factor in order to gain access. This makes it more difficult for them to gain access and decreases the chances of success.
It’s also important to note that two-factor authentication isn’t infallible and can be bypassed. However, it does add another layer of protection, making it much harder for hackers to gain access to your network. If you’re serious about keeping your data secure, two-factor authentication should be part of your cybersecurity strategy.

### 7) Review Your Cybersecurity Policies Regularly


Securing your networks from malicious attacks is a never-ending task that requires vigilance and regular review of existing policies. It’s essential to have a comprehensive cybersecurity policy in place, but it’s just as important to regularly review it to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date.
A well-defined cybersecurity policy should include all the different security measures you’re implementing, including access control, patch management, and secure data handling. Having this information on hand will help you identify any areas of weakness or gaps in your security strategy. It also helps you understand who is responsible for various tasks, like applying patches or monitoring access logs.
Once you have identified any potential gaps, you can then create action plans to address these issues. This could involve providing more training to employees on proper security protocols, implementing additional security tools, or creating new policies and procedures to better protect your networks.
Finally, when you do review your policies and make changes, it’s important to communicate these updates to all relevant stakeholders so that everyone understands their responsibilities and the importance of following proper cybersecurity protocols. Doing this will ensure that your network remains secure and resilient in the face of evolving threats.

To summarise, it's more important than ever to stay on top of network security measures. 
Taking the time to implement a few simple changes can make all the difference in protecting your data and systems from malicious actors. 
Keeping your software up-to-date, using strong passwords, using a VPN, avoiding public Wi-Fi, educating yourself and employees about cybersecurity, using two-factor authentication, and regularly reviewing your cybersecurity policies are all great ways to improve your network security today. 
Make sure to take these steps and be proactive in keeping your data safe.
