## Hardening Network Devices
---

Hardening is the process of securing a computer system or network by reducing its vulnerabilities to attacks. 
This can be done through a variety of measures, including enabling security features, configuring security protocols, updating software and firmware, and implementing best practices for password management and access control. 
Hardening a system can help protect against security threats such as malware, viruses, hacking, and unauthorized access. 
It is an important step in securing any network or device, as it helps to minimize the potential for security breaches and reduce the risk of data loss or damage.

Hardening is important because it helps to protect against security threats and vulnerabilities that can compromise the security and integrity of a computer system or network. 
By reducing the number of vulnerabilities, hardening can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach or data loss.

In addition to protecting against external threats, hardening can also help to protect against internal threats, such as malicious employees or contractors. 
It can also help to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Overall, hardening is an essential aspect of cybersecurity and is critical for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system or network.

There are several steps you can take to harden Cisco Catalyst switches:

Enable security features: Make sure you have enabled security features such as access control lists (ACLs), port security, and private VLANs to restrict unauthorized access to your network.

Use strong passwords: Use strong, complex passwords for all user accounts on the switch and enable password aging to regularly change passwords.

Configure security protocols: Configure security protocols such as SSH, TLS, and IPSec to encrypt communication between devices and protect against network attacks.

Enable security logging: Enable security logging on the switch to record any security-related events and help identify potential threats.

Update the switch firmware: Keep the switch firmware up to date to ensure that it has the latest security patches and fixes.

Monitor the network: Regularly monitor your network for security threats and suspicious activity.

Use VLANs: Use VLANs to segment your network and isolate different network segments from each other. This can help prevent unauthorized access and limit the impact of a security breach.

Use network access control: Use network access control technologies such as 802.1X and MAC filtering to control which devices are allowed to access your network.

Secure management interfaces: Secure the switch's management interfaces by limiting access to authorized personnel only and using strong passwords.

Use Network Address Translation (NAT): Use NAT to hide the IP addresses of internal devices from external networks, which can help protect against network attacks.

By following these best practices, you can help protect your Cisco Catalyst switches and the networks they support from security threats.

Here are some specific commands that you can use to configure and harden a Cisco Catalyst 9300 running the Nexus OS:

Enable SSH access: To enable SSH access, you can use the following command:

`switch(config)# ip ssh server`

Configure a banner: To display a banner message when users log in to the switch, use the following command:

`switch(config)# banner motd # Enter the banner message here. #`

Create a local user account: To create a local user account with a specific password, use the following command:

`switch(config)# username <username> password <password>`

Enable port security: To enable port security on a specific interface, use the following command:

`switch(config-if)# switchport port-security`
Configure an access control list (ACL): To create an ACL that allows only certain IP addresses to access the switch, use the following command:

`switch(config)# ip access-list <name>`
`switch(config-acl)# permit <IP address>`

Enable private VLANs: To enable private VLANs on the switch, use the following command:

`switch(config)# private-vlan primary`

Enable security logging: To enable security logging on the switch, use the following command:

`switch(config)# logging on`

Update the switch firmware: To update the switch firmware, you can use the following command:

`switch# install all nxos <image file name>`

By following these steps, you can harden and secure a Cisco Catalyst 9300 running the Nexus OS.

Here are some specific commands that you can use to configure VLANs on a Cisco network:

Create a VLAN: To create a VLAN, you can use the following command:
```
switch(config)# vlan <VLAN ID>
switch(config-vlan)# name <VLAN name>
```  
Assign an interface to a VLAN: To assign an interface to a specific VLAN, use the following command:
```
switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan <VLAN ID>
```  
Create a trunk link: To create a trunk link between two switches that allows multiple VLANs to be transmitted over a single link, use the following command:

`switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk`
  
Configure VLAN tagging: To configure VLAN tagging on a trunk link, use the following command:

`switch(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan <VLAN ID>`
  
By following these steps, you can effectively configure VLANs on a Cisco network and segment your network into logical segments.

Note: These commands are specific to Cisco IOS and may vary depending on the specific operating system being used.
